* <del>There is a problem with the git prompt that causes the cursor to skip ahead a couple of spaces 
when using tab completion.  It only occurs when in a git repo.</del>
* Add auto-updater.
** Auto-updater should only prompt when repo is behind, and perhaps only when a new tag appears.
** Experiment with various ways to check for update without too much overhead.
